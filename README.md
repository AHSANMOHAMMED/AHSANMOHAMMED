## About Me

```javascript
const Ahsan = {
  name: "Ahsan Mohammed",
  role: "Software Engineering Student",
  university: "SLIIT (Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology)",
  location: "Sri Lanka 🇱🇰",
  graduation: 2026,
  focus: {
    primary: "MERN Stack Development",
    secondary: "AI Integration",
    domain: "Hospitality & Hotel Management Systems"
  }
};
```

I build production-ready web applications and AI-enhanced features for hospitality and retail. I combine clean engineering, UX-aware frontends, and scalable backends to solve real-world problems — for example, automating menu extraction and improving hotel operational efficiency.
