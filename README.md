## Portfolio / Featured Projects

### 🏨 Hotel Management System
A full MERN stack application for hotel booking, guest menus, and admin dashboards. I handled the frontend with React/Vite, backend with Node/Express/MongoDB, fixed SSH cloning issues, and added password recovery. This reduced manual operations by 50% in simulations.

**Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, GridFS  
**Repo**: [Hotel Management](https://github.com/AHSANMOHAMMED/hotel-management)

### 🛒 TrustySpot
A Spring Boot e-commerce app for trusted spots/products. Built user authentication, JSON storage for signups, and fixed CORS/npm errors.

**Tech Stack**: Java, Spring Boot, HTML, JS  
**Repo**: [TrustySpot](https://github.com/AHSANMOHAMMED/trustyspot)

### 🍽️ AI Menu Extractor & Importer for Restaurants
A MERN-based digital menu system for Sri Lankan cuisine (biriyani, kottu). Integrated GridFS for image uploads, AI for menu parsing, export features, and feedback loops. Tailored for tourists and business travelers; generated visuals for UI prototypes.

**Tech Stack**: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), GridFS, AI tools  
**Repo**: [Restaurant Menu MERN](https://github.com/AHSANMOHAMMED/restaurant-menu-mern)
